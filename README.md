# Algorithm

1. **Detection and tracking**
   - Each camera frame on both cameras is masked so YOLO only sees the relevant road area (in debug mode, click M to see the masks)
   - A custom YOLO car detector runs on both cameras.
   - BotSort keeps stable per-camera track IDs for detected vehicles.

2. **Source-camera gallery creation**
   - The source camera is treated as the camera where vehicles should appear first.
   - While a source-camera track is visible, the system saves cropped vehicle images.
   - Crops are marked as **strong** when the vehicle is large enough, not overlapping another car, and moving in the expected direction. Other usable crops are kept as weak fallback crops.
   - If a source track crosses one of the configured discard lines (yellow lines), it is removed because it is moving toward an irrelevant exit.
   - When a source track disappears, the saved crops are converted into vehicle ReID embeddings and averaged into one gallery embedding for that source track.
   - Source records expire after `source_record_ttl_seconds` so old vehicles are not matched indefinitely.

3. **Query-camera candidate filtering**
   - Query-camera tracks are ignored if they appear in an area marked as not coming from the source camera (in debug mode, click O to see the mask)
   - For each remaining query track, the system stores ReID embeddings from its visible crops over time.
   - A query track becomes matchable after it crosses the configured query entry line.

4. **Cross-camera matching**
   - After a query track crosses the red entry line, its stored embeddings are averaged.
   - The averaged query embedding is compared with the source gallery using cosine similarity.
   - Matches are only considered if enough travel time has passed between the source track leaving and the query track crossing the entry line.
   - Weak source crops are penalized, and matches below the embedding-score threshold are treated as no match.

# Difficulties


# Known Issues  
Since this is basic computer vision and no deep learning, it's very sensitive to lighting changes. 
To compensate this, the setup file setup_color_get_range.py can update the colors. 

# Ideas to improve
- Tune the YOLO model 
- Batch or parallelize embedding inference for better real-time performance.
- Fine-tune embeddings model to get better embedding scores 
- Distribute source-camera embedding inference more efficiently to get a better FPS rate

## Use of AI

AI-assisted development tools (primarily Codex) were used throughout the project to accelerate implementation, 
refactoring, and boilerplate generation.

Core algorithmic design, system integration, and debugging were performed mostly manually. 
Some utility modules, geometry helpers, and visualization code were heavily AI-assisted and subsequently reviewed/modified.
